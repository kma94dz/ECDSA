# ECDSA
ECDSA in python, this code generates private keys ans public key, also can store keys in pem file format.
it isused for encryption of data.
# how it works 
ECDSA encrypts data using public key and decrypts it using privatekey. Example: if A communicate with B, then A will encrypt data using B's publicKey (pkB), and send it to B. in the other hand B will use his privateKey (prkB) to decrypt data.
# example
before encryption : data to encrypt!
